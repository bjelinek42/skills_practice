# 1. Write a program that uses variables to store a first and last name, then prints the full name in one line using string concatenation (the + operator).

# n = 'Ben'
# n2 = 'Larson'
# p n + " " + n2

# 2. Write a program that uses variables to store a first and last name, then prints the full name in one line using string interpolation (the #{} operator).

# n = 'Ben'
# n2 = 'Larson'
# p "#{n} #{n2}"

# 3. Write a program that asks the user to input a word. If the word is "marco", print "polo".

# p "Enter a word."
# n = gets.chomp
# if n == "marco"
#   p "polo"
# end

# 4. Write a program that uses variables to store three different colors, then prints out a sentence using the colors with string concatenation (the + operator).

# q = "orange"
# w = "red"
# e = "yellow"

# p "The " + q + " cat ate the " + w + " apple with a " + e + " fork."

# 5. Write a program that uses variables to store three different colors, then prints out a sentence using the colors with string interpolation (the #{} operator).

# q = "orange"
# w = "red"
# e = "yellow"

# p "The #{q} cat ate the #{w} apple with a #{e} fork."

# 6. Write a program that asks the user to enter a name. If the name is not "Santa", print "You're not Santa."

# p "Enter a name."
# name = gets.chomp
# if name != "Santa"
#   p "You're not Santa."
# end

# 7. Write a program that uses variables to store a book's title and author, then prints out a sentence using that information with string concatenation (the + operator).

# n = "The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy"
# n2 = "Douglas Adams"
# p n2 + " wrote " + n + "."

# 8. Write a program that uses variables to store a book's title and author, then prints out a sentence using that information with string interpolation (the #{} operator).

# n = "The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy"
# n2 = "Douglas Adams"
# p "#{n2} wrote #{n}."

# 9. Write a program that asks the user to enter a password. If the password is "Joshua", the program responds "Shall we play a game?". For any other password, the program responds "Access denied"

# p "enter a password."
# pass = gets.chomp
# if pass == "Joshua"
#   p "Shall we play a game?"
# else
#   p "Access denied"
# end

# 10. Write a program that uses variables to store the names of three cities, then prints out a sentence using that information with string concatenation (the + operator).

c1 = "Chicago"
c2 = "New York City"
c3 = "Los Angeles"
p "Three large cities are " + c1 + ", " + c2 + ", and " + c3 + "."
