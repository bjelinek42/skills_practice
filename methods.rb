# 1. Write a program that asks the user to enter a word, then prints that word with all capital letters.

# p "Enter a word"
# word = gets.chomp
# p word.upcase

# 2. Write a program that asks the user to enter a number, then prints "That's a big number" if the number is greater than 100.

# p "enter a number."
# n = gets.chomp
# if n.to_i > 100
#   p "that's a big number"
# end

# 3. Write a program that asks the user to enter two numbers, then prints the numbers added together.

# p "enter a number"
# n = gets.chomp
# p "enter a number"
# n2 = gets.chomp
# p n.to_i + n2.to_i

# 4. Write a program that asks the user to enter a word, then prints that word in reverse order.

# p "enter a word"
# word = gets.chomp
# p word.reverse

# 5. Write a program that asks the user to enter a number, then prints the number times 10.

# p "enter a number"
# n = gets.chomp
# p n.to_i * 10

# 6. Write a program that asks the user to enter two words, then prints both words on the same line in all capital letters.

# p "enter a word"
# n = gets.chomp
# p "enter a word"
# n2 = gets.chomp
# p n.upcase + " " + n2.upcase


# 7. Write a program that asks the user to enter a word, then prints the number of letters in the word.

# p "enter a word"
# w = gets.chomp
# p w.length


# 8. Write a program that asks the user to enter a number, then prints "That's a negative number" if the number is less than 0.

# p "enter a number"
# n = gets.chomp
# if n.to_i < 0
#   p "That's a negative number"
# end

# 9. Write a program that asks the user to enter two numbers, then prints the two numbers multiplied together.

# p "enter a number"
# n = gets.chomp
# p "enter a number"
# n2 = gets.chomp

# p n.to_i * n2.to_i

# 10. Write a program that asks the user to enter a word, then prints "That's a long word" if the word has more than 5 letters.

p "enter a word"
word = gets.chomp
if word.length > 5
  p "that's a long word"
end
